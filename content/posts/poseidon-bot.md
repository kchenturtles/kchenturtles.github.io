description: "Poseidon-Bot is an AI chatbot that uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) architecture to allow the model to specialize in documents uploaded by the user. This was a project I worked on as part of a summer internship with Boston University's SAIL Lab during the summer of 2024. I designed and developed the application end-to-end. The frontend was written in Flutter and the backend in Python (FASTApi). It used a PostgreSQL database and Llama LLM."
